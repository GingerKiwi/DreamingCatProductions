# Dreaming Cat Productions: Website, Landing Page, and Initial Branding for a Toronto Video Production Company

This repo is part of a project to establish a brand for my former college, friend Gordon Yarley. He's an amazing film and video producer, director, and screenwriter. His films have already been in three film festivals, and he just had an Instagram reel go viral. I've been wanting to do this for him for a while. His online presence and brand doesn't (yet!) match the quality of his film and video work. Branding, design, SEO, marketing, copywriting, and web development are my passions.

Besides, we're both cat owners, and his company name is so cool!
